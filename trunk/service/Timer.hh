// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Description:
//
//  The timer is used to execute a defined function at regular
//  intervals. The interval length, in ms, is defined by
//  duration(). When the timer goes off the function expired() is
//  called back. The task in which expired() is executed is defined by
//  the pointer returned by task(). In general the user builds a timer
//  by deriving by this class and implementing the pure virtual
//  functions expired(), duration() and task().
//
//  The timer is started by start() and stopped by cancel(). It's
//  possible to start-stop the timer more than once.
//
//  Note: It's required that cancel() is called before the
//  destructor. In the UNIX implementation we are guaranteed that,
//  when cancel() returns, no more call backs to expired() are
//  done. This cannot be done in the timer destructor because it could
//  be too late: the derived virtual class which implements the timer
//  has already been destroyed when the timer destructor is executed
//  and we get a crash if expired() is called back.
